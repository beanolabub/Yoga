      Yoga For Everyone!<br>
      with Yogi <b>Sandy Willmott</b> based in Lincoln, Lincolnshire.
    </p>
	<p>
	   I began practicing yoga about 25 years ago to try something different from 'feeling the burn' of the aerobics classes of the day. Little did I know that this would send me on a never-ending journey of physical, mental and spiritual challenges.</p>
	<p>   
		I soon discovered that yoga wasn't just another gym class and, realising that practising yoga regularly was beneficial on every level, I wanted to share this with others.
	<p>
		So, I trained as a yoga teacher, and now hold a British Wheel of Yoga BWYQ Level 4 diploma in teaching yoga. I have a range of clients : from people who have never set foot anywhere near a yoga mat, to those who have their own regular practice. I am fully insured and teach private students as well as my own group classes, open to all. I also teach chair yoga classes on Zoom.</p>
    <p>
		I am dedicated to furthering my understanding and knowledge of this amazing ancient practice, which has enhanced my life. I participate in regular workshops with some of the world's best teachers, including Jason Crandell, Howard Napper, Tara Styles and Peter Blackaby.</p>
